                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                <h3>Nicknames are Jaezelle, Jae, Jaz, Jaeden, Raen, Lyth</h3>
                <h3>Only Child</h3>
                <h3>Birthyear was 2004.</h3>
                <h3>Lives in Quezon City</h3>
                <h3>Have 2 dogs, named Leo and Lea</h3>
                <h3>Strict Person</h3>
                <h3>Taking BS in Information Technology at PUPQC</h3>
                <h3>Favorite Color is Yellow also love the combination of yellow and black</h3>
                <p>I have had amazing extracurricular activities since I was a kid. I joined several activities like Girl Scouts for 7 years, was a reservist, played Badminton, and was a member of the School Drum and Lyre in my elementary years. Also, I dance when it's required. I have a passion for playing Badminton. Last year, I joined the United Shuttlers Badminton Club (USBC). Having my own world means I am more comfortable in my own company, although I love being accompanied too, I prefer being alone. I don't have a long social battery to interact and socialize. Additionally, I have great experience and knowledge about businesses and handling money. I enjoy budgeting a lot. I am a short-tempered person, sometimes patient, but mostly not.</p>
                <p>Recently, I discovered my interest in learning more about making a website/webpage and digital arts. In fact, I loved arts and crafts when I was still a child, but suddenly lost interest. Doing digital arts is now one of my coping mechanisms. Before, I only binged on watching, sleeping, and imagining things that are not good for my mental health. Now, I've found a healthier outlet for my creativity and energy.</p>
                <p>Lastly, my hobbies are reading English stories and watching educational videos. Having a high level of curiosity is a good thing. It drives me to explore new topics and gain knowledge. Reading allows me to immerse myself in different worlds, while educational videos satisfy my thirst for learning. I believe that learning should be a lifelong journey, and I'm always seeking new ways to expand my horizons.</p>

                <h2>Preferences</h2>
                <h3>Life</h3>
                <p>I prefer low-key and private environments. They are more peaceful and allow me to focus on my thoughts. I find solace in the quiet and appreciate the simplicity of a calm atmosphere. Additionally, being in such settings helps me recharge and regain my energy.  I value wisdom, experience, and the ability to engage in meaningful conversations. Mature individuals often offer valuable perspectives and insights that contribute to personal growth. I find their company both enriching and inspiring.</p> <br>
                <h3>Fashion Fits</h3>
                <p>Simple yet Cool is my style. I am obsessed with Polo Shirts, Drifit Clothes, Baggy Jeans, and 4-Pocket Shorts. These pieces make up the core of my wardrobe, offering both comfort and style. When it comes to jewelry, I have a preference for silver accessories. In fact, my go-to jewelry and watch brand is Unisilver. I find myself drawn to rings and watches, feeling incomplete if I leave the house without them. They add a touch of elegance and personality to my everyday look. My wardrobe primarily consists of neutral colors, which I believe perfectly complement silver accessories. Shades like black, white, grey, and navy dominate my closet. These colors not only create a cohesive and versatile wardrobe but also serve as a backdrop for my silver jewelry to shine. The simplicity of my style allows me to mix and match effortlessly while still exuding a cool and put-together vibe.</p> <br>
                <h3>Pet Peeves</h3>
                <p>I find myself easily bothered by certain behaviors and environments that disrupt my sense of peace. Loud Chewing, Bad Manners, Interrupting, Slow walkers, Too much noice, Being Late, Cluttered Spaces, One-upmanship, Lack of Empathy, Excessive bragging, Passive-aggressive behavior, Lack of personal responsibility, Overly dramatic reactions, Emotional manipulation, and Insensitive jokes.</p>
                Note: I strive to create a space around me that promotes mutual respect, empathy, and a sense of calm.
